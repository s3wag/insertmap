## Tips for Testing SSRF
- [ ] Use Burp Collaborator to detect blind SSRF
- [ ] Try `http`, `https`, `gopher`, `file`, `dict`, `ftp`, and `ldap`
- [ ] Use DNS-based payloads (`http://yourdomain.burpcollaborator.net`)
- [ ] Try encoding (hex, URL-encoded, base64)
- [ ] Bypass filters using `@`, `#`, port smuggling, DNS rebinding
